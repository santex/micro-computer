Each record consists of several fields; the fields of all records form\nthe columns.\n\nIn object-oriented programming, field (also called data member or [[member\nvariable]]) is the data encapsulated within a class or object. In the case of a\nregular field (also called [[instance variable]]), for each instance of the\nobject there is an instance variable: for example, an Employee\nclass has a Name field and there is one distinct name per employee.\nA static field (also called [[class variable]]) is one variable, which is shared\nby all instances. {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-08-12 location = publisher = SLICCWARE title = Data fields\n| url = http://www.sliccware.com/WebHelp/Load_Definition/Definitions/Data_Field-\n| s/Data_Fields.htm}}\n\n","linknr":112,"url":"Field_(computer_science)","recorded":1362667531,"links":21,"instances":["computing","database","computer_science","database"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data modeling"],"headings":["Fixed length","Variable length","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["row","database"],["column","database"],["class","computer_science"],["object","object-oriented_programming"],["attribute","computing"],["row","database"]],"members":["attribute","object","row","class","column"],"related":["Computer_science","Relational_database","Database_record","Row_(database)","Column_(database)","Object-oriented_programming","Data","Information_hiding","Class_(computer_science)","Object_(object-oriented_programming)","Instance_variable","Comma-separated_values","Attribute_(computing)","Class_variable","Data_hierarchy","Instance_variable","Key_field","N-tuple","Row_(database)"]}
