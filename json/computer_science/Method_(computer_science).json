Methods define the behavior to be exhibited by\ninstances of the associated class at program run time. Methods have the special\nproperty that at runtime, they have access to data stored in an instance of the\nclass (or class instance or class object or object) they are associated with and\nare thereby able to control the state of the instance. {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-08-12 author = Mark Slagell year = 2008 location =\n| http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/ publisher = Ruby User's Guide title =\n| Methods quote = What is a method? In OO programming, we don't think of\n| operating on data directly from outside an object; rather, objects have some\n| understanding of how to operate on themselves (when asked nicely to do so).\n| You might say we pass messages to an object, and those messages will generally\n| elicit some kind of an action or meaningful reply. This ought to happen\n| without our necessarily knowing or caring how the object really works inside.\n| The tasks we are allowed to ask an object to perform (or equivalently, the\n| messages it understands) are that object's methods. url =\n| http://www.rubyist.net/~slagell/ruby/methods.html}}\n The association between class and method is called binding. A method\nassociated with a class is said to be bound to the class. Methods can be bound\nto a class at compile time (static binding) or to an object at runtime\n([[Dynamic dispatch|dynamic binding]]). {{cite web\n| accessdate = 2011-08-12 location = http://www.tolmol.com/ publisher = TOLMOL\n| Beta title = OOPS Interview Questions: 17.
