{"cursor":"13182","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computer science, a 'reference' is a value that enables a program to\nindirectly access a particular datum, such as a variable or a record, in the\ncomputer's memory or in some other storage device. The reference is said to\n'refer' to the datum, and accessing the datum is called '''dereferencing''' the\nreference.\n\nA reference is distinct from the data itself. Typically, a reference is the\nphysical address of where the data is stored in memory or in the storage device.\nFor this reason, a reference is often called a 'pointer' or 'address', and is\nsaid to 'point to' the data. However a reference may also be the offset\n(difference) between the datum's address and some fixed \"base\" address, or an\nindex into an array.\n\nThe concept of reference must not be confused with other values ([[unique\nkey|keys]] or [[identifier]]s) that uniquely identify the data item, but give\naccess to it only through a non-trivial lookup operation in some table data\nstructure.\n\nReferences are widely used in programming, especially to efficiently pass large\nor mutable data as arguments to procedures, or to share such data among various\nuses. In particular, a reference may point to a variable or record that contains\nreferences to other data. This idea is the basis of indirect addressing and of\nmany linked data structures, such as linked lists.\n","linknr":278,"url":"Reference_(computer_science)","recorded":1362485363,"links":30,"instances":["computer_science","programming","computer_science","computer_science","database","programming_language","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","computer_programming","programming_language","computer_science","computer_science","programming_language","programming_language","computing","computer_programming","programming_language","programming_language"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Data types","Programming language concepts","Primitive types"],"headings":["Benefits","Examples","Formal representation","External and internal storage","Language support","Symbolic references","References in object oriented languages","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["value","computer_science"],["variable","computer_science"],["record","computer_science"],["memory","computing"],["table","database"],["argument","computer_science"],["pointer","computer_programming"],["lock","computer_science"],["garbage_collection","computer_science"],["java","programming_language"],["python","programming_language"],["scheme","programming_language"],["lisp","programming_language"],["pointer","computer_programming"],["cast","computer_science"],["eiffel","programming_language"],["java","programming_language"],["c_sharp","programming_language"],["polymorphism","computer_science"],["assignment","computer_science#assignment_in_object_oriented_languages"],["method","computer_programming"],["garbage_collection","computer_science"],["abstraction","computer_science"],["variable","programming"]],"members":["cast","variable","polymorphism","lock","table","lisp","abstraction","argument","record","method","python","assignment","value","garbage_collection","java","scheme","memory","pointer","eiffel","c_sharp"],"related":["Computer_science","Value_(computer_science)","Data","Variable_(computer_science)","Record_(computer_science)","Computer","Memory_(computing)","Data_storage_device","Dereference_operator","Physical_address","Array_index","Array_data_structure","Lookup","Table_(database)","Computer_programming","Argument_(computer_science)","Subroutine","Indirect_addressing","Linked_data_structure","Linked_list","Evaluation_strategy","Pointer_(computer_programming)","Undefined_behavior","Smart_pointer","Opaque_pointer","Lock_(computer_science)","Distributed_computing","Web_services_description_language","Web_service","Live_distributed_object","Primary_key","Database","Associative_array","Nullable_type","Reachability_graph","Out-degree","Garbage_collection_(computer_science)","Unreachable_object","Dynamic_memory_allocation","Locality_of_reference","Recursive_data_type","Java_(programming_language)","Smalltalk","Python_(programming_language)","Scheme_(programming_language)","Assembly_language","Lisp_(programming_language)","Cons","Object_composition","Linked_list","Binary_tree","Call-by-reference","Pointer_(computer_programming)","Datatype","Weak_typing","Cast_(computer_science)","C++","Type_safety","C++_standard_library","Eiffel_(programming_language)","Java_(programming_language)","C_Sharp_(programming_language)","Visual_Basic","Fortran","Mutable","Standard_ML","OCaml","Polymorphism_(computer_science)","Algebraic_datatype","Perl","PHP","Method_(computer_programming)","Reference_counting","Garbage_collection_(computer_science)","Reference_type","Abstraction_(computer_science)","Autovivification","Bounded_pointer","Dereferenceable_Uniform_Resource_Identifier","Magic_cookie","Variable_(programming)","Weak_reference"]}
