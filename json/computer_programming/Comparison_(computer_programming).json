{"cursor":"20385","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In computer science, a 'relational operator' is a programming language construct\nor operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities.\nThese include numerical equality (e.g., 5 = 5) and inequalities (e.g.,\n4 â¥ 3).\n\nIn programming languages that include a distinct boolean data type in their type\nsystem, like Java, these operators return true or false, depending on whether\nthe conditional relationship between the two operands holds or not. In other\nlanguages such as C, relational operators return the integers 0 or 1. Some\nprogramming languages make a syntactical distinction between the \"equals\" of\nassignment (e.g. a = 1 assigns the value 1 to the variable \"a\") and\nthe \"equals\" of comparison ( if a == 1 then ... ). Other languages\ndetermine which is meant from context.\n\n\"Greater than\" and \"less than\" comparison of non-numeric data is performed\naccording to a sort convention (such as, for text strings, lexicographical\norder) which may be built in to the programming language and/or configurable by\nthe programmer.\n\nWhen it is desired to associate a numeric value with the result of a comparison\nbetween two data items, say \"a\" and \"b\", the usual convention is to assign\n−1 if a
