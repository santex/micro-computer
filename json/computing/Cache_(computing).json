{"cursor":"17398","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn computer science, a 'cache' (  {{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/cache |title=Cache |publisher=Merriam-Webster,\nIncorporated |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2 May\n2011}} ) is a component that transparently stores data so that future\nrequests for that data can be served faster. The data that is stored within a\ncache might be values that have been computed earlier or duplicates of original\nvalues that are stored elsewhere. If requested data is contained in the cache\n('cache hit'), this request can be served by simply reading the cache, which is\ncomparatively faster. Otherwise ('cache miss'), the data has to be recomputed or\nfetched from its original storage location, which is comparatively slower.\nHence, the greater the number of requests that can be served from the cache, the\nfaster the overall system performance becomes.\n\nTo be cost efficient and to enable an efficient use of data, caches are\nrelatively small. Nevertheless, caches have proven themselves in many areas of\ncomputing because access patterns in typical computer applications have locality\nof reference. References exhibit temporal locality if data is requested again\nthat has been recently requested already. References exhibit spatial locality if\ndata is requested that is physically stored close to data that has been\nrequested already.\n","linknr":270,"url":"Cache_(computing)","recorded":1362898139,"links":68,"instances":["protocol","database","computer_science","computer_science","data_storage","computer_science"],"pdf":["http://www.unilim.fr/sci/wiki/_media/cali/cpumemory.pdf","http://comp.eprints.lancs.ac.uk/2044/1/MMCN09.pdf"],"categories":["Cache (computing)|"],"headings":["Operation","Applications","See also","Further reading","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Cache%2Cbasic.svg/320px-Cache%2Cbasic.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Write_through_with_no-write_allocation.png/220px-Write_through_with_no-write_allocation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/Write_back_with_write_allocation.png/220px-Write_back_with_write_allocation.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["block","data_storage"],["heuristic","computer_science"],["kernel","computer_science"],["block","data_storage"],["network_file_system","protocol"],["index","database"],["instruction","computer_science"]],"members":["network_file_system","index","kernel","instruction","block","heuristic"],"related":["Computer_science","Application_software","Locality_of_reference","Memory_locality","Spatial_locality","Block_(data_storage)","CPU","Hard_drive","Datum","Operating_system","Heuristic_(computer_science)","Cache_algorithm","Cache_algorithm","Access_time","Cache_coherency","CPU","Microprocessors","Memory_management_unit","Page_cache","Main_memory","Kernel_(computer_science)","Disk_buffer","Disk_controller","Block_(data_storage)","Web_cache","Tape_drive","Optical_jukebox","Hierarchical_storage_management","Web_browser","Proxy_server","Web_server","Web_page","Image","Responsiveness","Internet_Service_Provider","P2P_caching","Peer-to-peer","ISP","Domain_Name_System","IP_address","Cache_coherency","Client-side","Network_File_System","Network_File_System_(protocol)","Server_Message_Block","Web_search_engine","Web_page","Google","Web_server","Memoization","Ccache","Database_caching","Database","Index_(database)","Data_dictionary","Distributed_cache","Data_buffer","Instruction_(computer_science)","Data_buffer","Abstraction_layer","Cache_algorithms","Cache_coherence","Cache_coloring","Cache_hierarchy","Cache-oblivious_algorithm","Cache_stampede","Cache_language_model","Database_cache","Dirty_bit","Disk_buffer","Cache_manifest_in_HTML5","Pipeline_burst_cache","Ulrich_Drepper"]}
