{"cursor":"29035","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn computer security, a 'vulnerability' is a weakness which allows an attacker\nto reduce a system's information assurance. 'Vulnerability' is the\nintersection of three elements: a system susceptibility or flaw, attacker access\nto the flaw, and attacker capability to exploit the flaw. {{cite web\n  | last = first = authorlink = http://www.spi.dod.mil/index.htm coauthors =\n  | title = The Three Tenents of Cyber Security work = publisher = U.S. Air\n  | Force Software Protection Initiative date = url =\n  | http://www.spi.dod.mil/tenets.htm doi = accessdate = 2009-12-15\n}} To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one\napplicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this\nframe, vulnerability is also known as the attack surface.\n\nVulnerability management is the cyclical practice of identifying, classifying,\nremediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities\" Foreman, P: Vulnerability\nManagement, page 1. Taylor & Francis Group, 2010. ISBN 978-1-4398-0150-5\nThis practice generally refers to software vulnerabilities in computing systems.\n\nA security risk may be classified as a vulnerability. The usage of\nvulnerability with the same meaning of risk can lead to confusion. The risk is\ntied to the potential of a significant loss. Then there are vulnerabilities\nwithout risk: for example when the affected asset has no value. A vulnerability\nwith one or more known instances of working and fully implemented attacks is\nclassified as an exploitable vulnerability â a vulnerability for which an\nexploit exists. The 'window of vulnerability' is the time from when the\nsecurity hole was introduced or manifested in deployed software, to when access\nwas removed, a security fix was available/deployed, or the attacker was\ndisabledâsee zero-day attack.\n\nSecurity bug (security defect) is a narrower concept: there are vulnerabilities\nthat are not related to software: hardware, site, personnel vulnerabilities are\nexamples of vulnerabilities that are not software security bugs.\n\nConstructs in programming languages that are difficult to use properly can be a\nlarge source of vulnerabilities.\n","linknr":370,"url":"Vulnerability_(computing)","recorded":1362668985,"links":39,"instances":["computer","computing","computer_security","computer","computing","computer_security","networking","telecommunication","computing","security"],"pdf":["http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/phishing.pdf","http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf","http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf","http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf","http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/Documents/RiskIT-FW-18Nov09-Research.pdf","http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.26.5435&rep=rep1&type=pdf"],"categories":["Computer
