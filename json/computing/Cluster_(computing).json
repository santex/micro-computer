{"cursor":"26191","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n cluster at the Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany]]\n\nA 'computer cluster' consists of a set of loosely connected computers that work\ntogether so that in many respects they can be viewed as a single system.\n\nThe components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast\nlocal area networks, each node (computer used as a server) running its own\ninstance of an operating system. Computer clusters emerged as a result of\nconvergence of a number of computing trends including the availability of low\ncost microprocessors, high speed networks, and software for high performance\ndistributed computing.\n\nClusters are usually deployed to improve performance and availability over that\nof a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single\ncomputers of comparable speed or availability.\n\nComputer clusters have a wide range of applicability and deployment, ranging\nfrom small business clusters with a handful of nodes to some of the fastest\nsupercomputers in the world such as IBM's Sequoia.\n","linknr":563,"url":"Cluster_(computing)","recorded":1362901740,"links":57,"instances":["programming_language","computing","computing","computing","networking","programming_language","computer_science","computer_cluster","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Cluster
