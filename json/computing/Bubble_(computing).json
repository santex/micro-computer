{"cursor":"2407","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn computing, a 'bubble' is an alternative name for a pipeline stall. It\nrepresents a delay in execution of an instruction in an instruction pipeline in\norder to resolve a hazard.\n\nDuring the decoding stage, the control unit will determine if the decoded\ninstruction reads from a register that the instruction currently in the\nexecution stage writes to. If this condition holds, the control unit will stall\nthe instruction by one clock cycle. It also stalls the instruction in the fetch\nstage, to prevent the instruction in that stage from being overwritten by the\nnext instruction in the program.\n\nTo prevent new instructions from being fetched when an instruction in the\ndecoding stage has been stalled, the value in the PC register and the\ninstruction in the fetch stage are preserved to prevent changes. The values are\npreserved until the bubble has passed through the execution stage.\n\nThe execution stage of the pipeline must always be performing an action. A\nbubble is represented in the execution stage as a NOP instruction, which has no\neffect other than to stall the instructions being executed in the pipeline.\n","linknr":114,"url":"Bubble_(computing)","recorded":1362480523,"links":20,"instances":["computer_architecture"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Instruction processing","Bubbles"],"headings":["Example","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Pipeline%2C_4_stage.svg/300px-Pipeline%2C_4_stage.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Pipeline%2C_4_stage_with_bubble.svg/300px-Pipeline%2C_4_stage_with_bubble.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Microelectronics_stub.svg/40px-Microelectronics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["hazard","computer_architecture"]],"members":["hazard"],"related":["Computing","Instruction_set","Instruction_pipeline","Hazard_(computer_architecture)","Program_counter","NOP","Wait_state"]}
