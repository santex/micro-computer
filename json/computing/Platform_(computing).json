Typical platforms include a computer\narchitecture, operating system, programming languages and related user interface\n(run-time system libraries or graphical user interface).\n\nA platform is a crucial element in software development. A platform might be\nsimply defined as a place to launch software. The platform provider offers the\nsoftware developer an undertaking that logic code will run consistently as long\nas the platform is running on top of other platforms. Logic code includes\nbytecode, source code, and machine code. It actually means execution of the\nprogram is not restricted by the type of operating system provided.\n\nSome software platforms emulate entire hardware platforms as in systems\nvirtualization.\n","linknr":243,"url":"Platform_(computing)","recorded":1362476949,"links":41,"instances":["framework","operating_system","programming_language","operating_system","software","operating_system","programming_language","platform"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computing platforms|"],"headings":["Operating system examples","Software frameworks","Hardware examples","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/Android_4.0.png/150px-Android_4.0.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["solaris","operating_system"],["vm","operating_system"],["android","operating_system"],["java","software_platform"],["mono","software"],["qt","framework"],["java","software_platform"],["java","programming_language"],["c","programming_language"],["newton","platform"],["solaris","operating_system"]],"members":["qt","solaris","java","android","mono","vm","c","newton"],"related":["Hardware_architecture","Software_framework","Application_framework","Computer_software","Application_software","Computer_architecture","Operating_system","Programming_language","Run-time_system","Graphical_user_interface","Software_developer","Bytecode","Source_code","Machine_code","Systems_virtualization","AmigaOS","AmigaOS_4","FreeBSD","NetBSD","OpenBSD","Linux","Mac_OS","Microsoft_Windows","OS/2","Solaris_(operating_system)","Unix","VM_(operating_system)","Android_(operating_system)","Bada","BlackBerry_OS","IOS","Embedded_Linux","Palm_OS","Symbian","WebOS","Windows_Mobile","Windows_Phone","Adobe_AIR","Adobe_Flash","Adobe_Shockwave","Binary_Runtime_Environment_for_Wireless","Java_(software_platform)","Java_Platform,_Micro_Edition","Java_Platform,_Standard_Edition","Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition","JavaFX","JavaFX_Mobile","Microsoft_XNA","Mono_(software)","Mozilla_Prism","XUL","XULRunner",".NET_Framework","Silverlight","Oracle_Database","Qt_(framework)","Smartface","Vexi","Java_(software_platform)","Java_(programming_language)","Bytecode","Java_Virtual_Machine","Smartphone","Personal_digital_assistant","Java_ME","SAP_NetWeaver","SAP_AG","SAP_Business_Suite","Service-oriented_architecture","Enterprise_application_integration","ABAP","C_(programming_language)","C++","Java_EE","JBoss","Microsoft","Microsoft_.NET","Java_EE","IBM","WebSphere","Commodity_computing","Wintel","X86","Personal_computer_hardware","Microsoft_Windows","ARM_architecture","Gumstix","Linux","X86","Unix-like","Berkeley_Software_Distribution","CP/M","S-100_bus","Microcomputer","Video_game_console","Macintosh","Apple_Inc.","Mac_OS","Newton_(platform)","Newton_OS","Apple_Pippin","RISC","SPARC","Solaris_(operating_system)","DEC_Alpha","Cluster_computing","OpenVMS","Midrange_computer","OS/400","Mainframe_computer","International_Business_Machines","Z/OS","Supercomputer","Application_programming_interface","Compatibility_layer","Just-in-time_compilation","Platform_technology"]}
