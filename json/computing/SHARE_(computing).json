It evolved into a forum for\nexchanging technical information about programming languages, operating systems,\ndatabase systems, and user experiences for enterprise users of small, medium,\nand large-scale IBM computers such as IBM S/360, IBM S/370, zSeries, pSeries,\nand xSeries.\n\nA major resource of SHARE from the beginning was the SHARE library. Originally,\nIBM's operating systems were distributed in source\nform [http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html Dave\nPitts' IBM 7090/7094 Page] â€“ An example of distributed source: Page\ncontains a link to IBM 7090/94 IBSYS source, including COBOL and FORTRAN\ncompilers.  and it was common for systems programmers to make small local\nadditions or modifications and to exchange them with other users. The SHARE\nlibrary and the process of distributed development it fostered was one of the\nmajor origins of open source software.\n\nSHARE was later incorporated as a non-profit corporation based in Chicago,\nIllinois and is currently located at 330 N. Wabash Ave. The organization\nproduces a newsletter and conducts two major educational meetings per year.\n\nIn September 1999, GUIDE International, the other major IBM mainframe users\ngroup, ceased operation. Although SHARE did not formally take over GUIDE, many\nof the activities and projects that were undertaken under the aegis of GUIDE\nmoved to SHARE, and GUIDE suggested to its members that they join SHARE. In\nAugust 2000, SHARE took over the guide.org domain name.\n\nToday, SHARE's membership of 20,000 represents some 2,300 enterprise IBM\ncustomers.\n","linknr":248,"url":"SHARE_(computing)","recorded":1362673553,"links":20,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://web.archive.org/web/20060513145315/http://www.princeton.edu/~melinda/25paper.pdf","http://www.princeton.edu/~melinda/25paper.pdf","http://web.archive.org/web/20060513145315/http://www.princeton.edu/~melinda/25paper.pdf"],"categories":["IBM","User groups","Free software culture and documents","Organizations based in Chicago, Illinois"],"headings":["See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Handshake_%28Workshop_Cologne_%2706%29.jpeg/30px-Handshake_%28Workshop_Cologne_%2706%29.jpeg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf8/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["IBM","Mainframe_computer","Los_Angeles","IBM_701","Programming_language","Operating_system","Database_system","IBM_computer","System/360","System/370","ZSeries","PSeries","IBM_System_x","IBM_7090/94_IBSYS","Systems_programming","Open_source","Chicago,_Illinois","History_of_free_software","SHARE_Operating_System","DECUS","Seven_tiers_of_disaster_recovery","Charles_Babbage_Institute","Charles_Babbage_Institute"]}
