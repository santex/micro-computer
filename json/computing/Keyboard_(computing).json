{"cursor":"53853","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"{{multiple issues|\n\n\n\n}}\n\nIn computing, a 'keyboard' is a , which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys,\nto act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Following the decline of\npunch cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became\nthe main input device for computers.\n\nA keyboard typically has characters engraved or printed on the keys and each\npress of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, to\nproduce some symbols requires pressing and holding several keys simultaneously\nor in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs\n(characters), other keys or simultaneous key presses can produce actions or\ncomputer commands.\n\nDespite the development of alternative input devices, such as the mouse,\ntouchscreen, pen devices, character recognition and voice recognition, the\nkeyboard remains the most commonly used and most versatile device used for\ndirect (human) input into computers.\n\nIn normal usage, the keyboard is used to type text and numbers into a word\nprocessor, text editor or other programs. In a modern computer, the\ninterpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A computer\nkeyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all key\npresses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer\ngaming, either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming\nfeatures, which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard\nis also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as\nWindows' Control-Alt-Delete combination, which brings up a task window or shuts\ndown the machine. Keyboards are the only way to enter commands on a command-line\ninterface.\n","linknr":899,"url":"Keyboard_(computing)","recorded":1362675477,"links":126,"instances":["palm_os","computing","computing","computing","computing","alphabet","computing","software"],"pdf":["http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/herley-poster_abstract.pdf","http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/herley-poster_abstract.pdf"],"categories":["American
