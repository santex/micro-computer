{"cursor":"12718","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n.]] In computing, a 'process' is an instance of a computer program that is being\nexecuted. It contains the program code and its current activity. Depending on\nthe operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of\nexecution that execute instructions concurrently.\n\nA computer program is a passive collection of instructions; a process is the\nactual execution of those instructions. Several processes may be associated with\nthe same program; for example, opening up several instances of the same program\noften means more than one process is being executed.\n\nMultitasking is a method to allow multiple processes to share processors (CPUs)\nand other system resources. Each CPU executes a single task at a time. However,\nmultitasking allows each processor to switch between tasks that are being\nexecuted without having to wait for each task to finish. Depending on the\noperating system implementation, switches could be performed when tasks perform\ninput/output operations, when a task indicates that it can be switched, or on\nhardware interrupts.\n\nA common form of multitasking is time-sharing. Time-sharing is a method to allow\nfast response for interactive user applications. In time-sharing systems,\ncontext switches are performed rapidly. This makes it seem like multiple\nprocesses are being executed simultaneously on the same processor. The execution\nof multiple processes seemingly simultaneously is called concurrency.\n\nFor security and reliability reasons most modern operating systems prevent\ndirect communication between independent processes, providing strictly mediated\nand controlled inter-process communication functionality.\n","linknr":442,"url":"Process_(computing)","recorded":1362477418,"links":55,"instances":["computing","computing","computer_science","computers","operating_system","subroutine","computing","computing","computing","computers","computer_science","computer_architecture","computer_science","computer_science","operating_system","computer_science","computing","operating_system"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Operating
