{"cursor":"4762","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computing, the term 'group' generally refers to a grouping of users. In\nprinciple, users may belong to none, one, or many groups (although in practice\nsome systems place limits on this.) The primary purpose of user groups is to\nsimplify access control to computer systems.\n\nSuppose a computer science department has a network which is shared by students\nand academics. The department has made a list of directories which the students\nare permitted to access and another list of directories which the staff are\npermitted to access. Without groups, administrators would give each student\npermission to every student directory, and each staff member permission to every\nstaff directory. In practice, that would be very unworkable â every time a\nstudent or staff member arrived, administrators would have to allocate\npermissions on every directory.\n\nWith groups, the task is much simpler: create a student group and a staff group,\nplacing each user in the proper group. The entire group can be granted access to\nthe appropriate directory. To add or remove an account, one must only need to do\nit in one place (in the definition of the group), rather than on every\ndirectory. This workflow provides clear separation of concerns: to change access\npolicies, alter the directory permissions; to change the individuals which fall\nunder the policy, alter the group definitions.\n","linknr":111,"url":"Group_(computing)","recorded":1362477191,"links":13,"instances":["database","computing","unix","computing","variable","file_systems"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Identity management"],"headings":["Uses of groups","Delegable group administration","Static vs. dynamic groups","Roles","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["user","computing"],["directory","file_systems"],["bandwidth","computing"],["path","variable"],["group","database"],["group_identifier","unix"]],"members":["group","bandwidth","group_identifier","user","path","directory"],"related":["User_(computing)","Computer","Computer_network","Student","Academics","Directory_(file_systems)","System_administrator","Bandwidth_(computing)","Path_(variable)","Mailing_list","Chess","Electronic_mailing_lists","Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol","Academic_degree","Bachelor","Computer_Science","First_year","Sun","Netscape","IPlanet","Group_(database)","Group_identifier_(Unix)"]}
