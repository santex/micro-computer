The concept also includes control\ncharacters, which do not correspond to symbols in a particular natural\nlanguage, but rather to other bits of information used to process text in one\nor more languages. Examples of control characters include carriage return or\ntab, as well as instructions to printers or other devices that display or\notherwise process text.\n\nCharacters are typically combined into strings.\n","linknr":263,"url":"Character_(computing)","recorded":1362372641,"links":36,"instances":["programming_language","alphabet","computer_science","letter","programming_language"],"pdf":["http://anubis.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/tr15285:1998.pdf"],"categories":["Character encoding","Data types","Digital typography","Primitive types"],"headings":["Character encoding","Terminology","char","Word character","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["letter","alphabet"],["string","computer_science"],["aleph","letter"],["c","programming_language"],["c++","programming_language"]],"members":["c","letter","string","aleph"],"related":["Computer","Telecommunication","Information","Grapheme","Alphabet","Syllabary","Written_language","Natural_language","Letter_(alphabet)","Numerical_digit","Punctuation","Control_character","Carriage_return","Tab_key","Computer_printer","String_(computer_science)","Character_encoding","Integer","Bit","Computer_storage","Computer_network","ASCII","UTF-8","Unicode","Morse_code","Application_programming_interface","Glyph","Typeface","Data","Universal_Character_Set","Hebrew_alphabet","Aleph_(letter)","Aleph_number","Chinese_script","Logogram","Japanese_script","Typeface","Combining_character","C_(programming_language)","C++_(programming_language)","Byte","UTF-8","Unicode","UTF-8","Wide_characters","Wchar_t","UTF-16","Fill_character","Combining_character","Universal_Character_Set_characters"]}
