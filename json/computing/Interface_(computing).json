{"cursor":"11800","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Interface}}\n\n\nIn the field of computer science, an 'interface' is a tool and concept that\nrefers to a point of interaction between components, and is applicable at the\nlevel of both hardware and software. This allows a component, whether a piece of\nhardware such as a graphics card or a piece of software such as an Internet\nbrowser, to function independently while using interfaces to communicate with\nother components via an input/output system and an associated protocol.\n\nA computing interface may also refer to the means of communication between the\ncomputer and the user by means of peripheral devices such as a monitor or a\nkeyboard, an interface with the Internet via Internet Protocol, or any other\npoint of communication involving a computer.\n\nMost computer interfaces are bi-directional, but some, such as a simple mouse or\nmicrophone, are uni-directional.\n","linknr":303,"url":"Interface_(computing)","recorded":1362667814,"links":51,"instances":["computing","computer_science","programming","computing","data_structure","programming_language","computing","programming","computer_programming","computer_science","programming_language","computer_science","computer_science","computer_science","computing"],"pdf":["http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/Part2.pdf","http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CSharp/Tutorial/Part2.pdf"],"categories":["Interfaces|","Object-oriented programming","Programming constructs"],"headings":["Hardware interfaces","Software interfaces","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["protocol","computing"],["keyboard","computing"],["bus","computing"],["stream","computing"],["method","computer_science"],["constant","computer_science"],["variable","programming"],["comment","computer_programming"],["method","computer_science"],["class","computer_science"],["function","computer_science"],["method","computer_science"],["class","computer_science"],["stack","data_structure"],["java","programming_language"],["constant","programming"],["c_sharp","programming_language"],["property","computer_science"],["implementation","computer_science"]],"members":["protocol","function","variable","bus","stack","java","stream","constant","comment","implementation","c_sharp","class","method","property","keyboard"],"related":["Computer_science","Tool","Concept","Computer_hardware","Computer_software","Video_card","Web_browser","Input/output","Protocol_(computing)","Peripheral","Computer_monitor","Keyboard_(computing)","Internet","Internet_Protocol","Bus_(computing)","Computer_data_storage","I/O","SCSI","I/O","Parallel_communication","Serial_communication","Software_interface","Application_software","Computer_program","Stream_(computing)","Object-oriented_programming","Method_(computer_science)","Constant_(computer_science)","Data_type","Subroutine","Exception_handling","Method_signature","Variable_(programming)","Comment_(computer_programming)","Liskov_substitution_principle","Object-oriented","Abstract_data_type","Method_(computer_science)","Class_(computer_science)","Data_type","Function_(computer_science)","Method_(computer_science)","Class_(computer_science)","Stack_(data_structure)","Java_(programming_language)","Marker_interface_pattern","Constant_(programming)","Static_function","C_Sharp_(programming_language)","Property_(computer_science)","Syntactic_sugar","Inversion_of_control","Abstraction_inversion","Application_binary_interface","Application_programming_interface","Business_Interoperability_Interface","Computer_bus","Implementation_(computer_science)","Implementation_inheritance","Inheritance_semantics","Modular_programming","Software_componentry","User_interface","Virtual_inheritance"]}
