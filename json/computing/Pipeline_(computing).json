The circuitry is usually divided\nup into stages, including instruction decoding, arithmetic, and register\nfetching stages, wherein each stage processes one instruction at a time.\n*Graphics pipelines, found in most graphics cards, which consist of multiple\narithmetic units, or complete CPUs, that implement the various stages of common\nrendering operations (perspective projection, window clipping, color and light\ncalculation, rendering, etc.).\n* Software pipelines, where commands can be written so that the output of one\n  operation is automatically used as the input to the next, following operation.\n  The Unix system call pipe is a classic example of this concept; although other\n  operating systems do support pipes as well.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Pipeline_(computing)","recorded":1362484661,"links":28,"instances":["engineering","computer_science","unix"],"pdf":["http://www.zipcores.com/skin1/zipdocs/appnotes/app_note_zc001.pdf"],"categories":["Instruction processing"],"headings":["Concept and motivation","Pipeline categories","Costs and drawbacks","Design considerations","Implementations","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Pentium4superpipeline.png/343px-Pentium4superpipeline.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["buffer","computer_science"],["pipeline","software"],["pipeline","unix"],["latency","engineering"],["pipeline","software"],["pipeline","unix"]],"members":["latency","buffer","pipeline"],"related":["Computing","Buffer_(computer_science)","Instruction_pipeline","Classic_RISC_pipeline","Central_processing_unit","Digital_electronics","Graphics_pipeline","Graphics_cards","Arithmetic_and_logical_unit","Central_processing_unit","Perspective_projection","Color","Light","Pipeline_(software)","Pipeline_(Unix)","Assembly_line","Throughput","Latency_(engineering)","Synchronous_circuit","Hardware_register","Clock_signal","Asynchronous_circuit","AMULET_microprocessor","Throughput","Parallel_computing","Instruction_pipeline","Classic_RISC_pipeline","Graphics_pipeline","Pipeline_(software)","Pipeline_(Unix)","Hartmann_pipeline","BatchPipes","Geometry_pipelines","XML_pipeline"]}
