{"cursor":"6436","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computing, a 'hang' or 'freeze' occurs when either a single computer program\nor the whole system ceases to respond to inputs. In the most commonly\nencountered scenario, a workstation with a graphical user interface, all windows\nbelonging to the frozen program become static, and though the mouse cursor still\nmoves on the screen, neither typing on the keyboard nor clicking the mouse\nproduces any effect in the program's windows. The mouse cursor may also be stuck\nin a form indicating that it is waiting for some operation to complete, such as\nan hourglass or a spinning wait cursor.\n\nMany modern operating systems provide the user with a means to terminate a hung\nprogram without rebooting or logging out. In more severe hangs affecting the\nwhole system, no window belonging to any program will respond to keyboard or\nmouse input, and often the mouse cursor will freeze in place on the screen.\nAlmost always, the only way to recover from a system freeze is to reboot the\nmachine, usually by power cycling with an on/off or reset button.\n\nIn the Windows 7 and Windows Vista operating systems, hangs almost always\nprecedes a Blue Screen of Death or are a sign to the user that one is on its\nway. On Windows systems, if clicked on, a hanging program will gain \"Not\nResponding\" in parentheses on its top bar.\n\nA hang differs from a crash, in which a program exits abnormally or the\noperating system shuts down.\n\nHangs are not limited to client personal computers with a graphical user\ninterface, as in the example above. Servers can hang as well. In those cases,\nthe server ceases to respond to requests. These sorts of hangs are typically\naddressed by a solution far more complex than an on/off or reset button.\n\nPre-emptive multitasking operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows\n2000/XP/Vista/7, Apple Computer's Mac OS X and Linux hang less often as the multi-\ntasking system is not affected by non-terminating loops and further does not\nrequire tasks to yield control to the operating system. If a task does hang, the\nscheduler may switch to another group of interdependent tasks so that all\nprocesses will not hang.\n","linknr":165,"url":"Hang_(computing)","recorded":1362893064,"links":21,"instances":["computing","computer","computing","command","computing","computer_science","computing","computer_science","computing","computing"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Computer errors","Software anomalies","Computing terminology"],"headings":["Causes","Solutions","References","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["rebooting","computing"],["crash","computing"],["client","computing"],["server","computing"],["thread","computer_science"],["signal","computing"],["kernel","computer_science"],["kill","command"],["reboot","computer"],["abort","computing"],["crash","computing"]],"members":["rebooting","reboot","abort","kill","client","thread","signal","kernel","server","crash"],"related":["Computing","Computer_program","Input/output","Personal_computer","Graphical_user_interface","Hourglass","Spinning_wait_cursor","Rebooting_(computing)","Logging_out","Power_cycling","Windows_7","Windows_Vista","Blue_Screen_of_Death","Crash_(computing)","Client_(computing)","Graphical_user_interface","Server_(computing)","Pre-emptive_multitasking","Microsoft","Windows_2000","Windows_XP","Windows_Vista","Windows_7","Apple_Computer","Mac_OS_X","Linux","Personal_computer_hardware","Upgrade","Program_loop","Co-operative_multitasking","Operating_system","Software","Thread_(computer_science)","Infinite_loop","Race_hazard","Computer_process","Signal_(computing)","Deadlock","Uninterruptible_sleep","Kernel_(computer_science)","RAM","Memory_fragmentation","Spyware","Operating_system","Kill_(command)","Microsoft_Windows","MS-DOS","Windows_3.1x","Hard_reboot","Watchdog_timer","Reboot_(computer)","Abort_(computing)","Anomaly_in_software","Blue_Screen_of_Death","Crash_(computing)","Deadlock","Livelock","Infinite_loop","Uninterruptible_sleep"]}
