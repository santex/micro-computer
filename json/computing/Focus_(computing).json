{"cursor":"5005","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn computing, the 'focus' indicates the component of the graphical user\ninterface which is currently selected to receive input. Text entered at the\nkeyboard or pasted from a clipboard is sent to the component which currently\nhas the focus. Moving the focus away from a specific user interface element is\nknown as a 'blur' event in relation to this element. Typically, the focus is\nwithdrawn from an element by giving another element the focus. This means that\nfocus and blur events typically both occur virtually simultaneously, but in\nrelation to different user interface elements, one that gets the focus and one\nthat gets blurred.\n\nThe concept is similar to a cursor in a text-based environment. However, when\nconsidering a graphical interface, there is also a mouse cursor involved. Moving\nthe mouse will typically move the mouse cursor without changing the focus. The\nfocus can usually be changed by clicking on a component that can receive focus\nwith the mouse. Many desktops also allow the focus to be changed with the\nkeyboard. By convention, the tab key is used to move the focus to the next\nfocusable component and shift + tab to the previous one. When graphical\ninterfaces were first introduced, many computers did not have mice, so this\nalternative was necessary. This feature makes it easier for people that have a\nhard time using a mouse to use the user interface. In certain circumstances, the\narrow keys can also be used to move focus.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Focus_(computing)","recorded":1362667596,"links":18,"instances":["software","window_manager","window_manager","window_manager"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Graphical user interfaces","User interface techniques"],"headings":["Window focus","Intra-window component focus","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["clipboard","software"],["enlightenment","window_manager"],["karmen","window_manager"],["whim","window_manager"]],"members":["clipboard","enlightenment","whim","karmen"],"related":["Computing","Graphical_user_interface","Clipboard_(software)","Computer_mouse","Arrow_key","Microsoft","Apple_Inc.","UNIX","X11","Aewm","Aewm++","Ahwm","Ctwm","Dwm","Enlightenment_(window_manager)","Evilwm","Flwm","Fluxbox","Fvwm","Karmen_(window_manager)","Lwm","Tinywm","Whim_(window_manager)","Windowlab","Autoraise","Xfwm4","Tab_order","Focus_stealing"]}
